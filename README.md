# employee-recruitment-prediction
A machine learning project that predicts employee recruitment outcomes using candidate data, enabling data-driven hiring decisions.
This project focuses on predicting employee recruitment outcomes using machine learning techniques. The objective is to assist organizations in making data-driven hiring decisions by analyzing candidate information and predicting selection results.

## Problem Statement
Hiring the right candidate is a critical and time-consuming process. This project aims to automate and improve recruitment decision-making by building a predictive model based on historical recruitment data.

## Dataset
The dataset contains candidate-related attributes such as:
- Academic performance
- Work experience
- Skills and qualifications
- Other relevant recruitment features

The target variable represents whether a candidate is **selected or not selected**.

## Approach
The project follows these steps:
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training using machine learning algorithms
5. Model evaluation and performance analysis

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## Results
The trained model demonstrates the ability to predict recruitment outcomes with reasonable accuracy, showing the potential of machine learning in supporting recruitment and HR analytics.

## Future Improvements
- Try advanced models such as Random Forest or XGBoost  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning  
- Add a web interface for real-time predictions
